### Feasibility
- Human Level Performance
    - Unstructured Data: Videos, Images and Voice; HLP (Human Level Performance) is the base performance for ML models.
    - Structured Data: Humans are bad are analyzing tables, ML models perform better.
- Availability of Predictive Features; example: Sales for today.
- Project History; example: Error history trend reduction.

Very bored (2:55 PM)
Need coffee (2:56 PM)

### Value Estimation - Ethical Concern
- Create +ve social impact:
- Fair and free form bias; Example: loan for all individuals (Protected attributes).
- Ethical Concern; Check for current ethical concerns?

### Milestones and Resourcing
- Success/Failure Metrics.
    - Metrics Viewpoints: ML (Precision, Accuracy, Fairness...); Software (Scalability, Availability...); Business (Revenue, Customer retention...)
- Required Resources (Human and Infra).
- Timeline.

### Approach
- Data Centric Approach
  - Fixed Model, Data can change.
- Model centric Approach
  - Fixed Data, Model can change.
  - Used in AI.
- Practically, use both.

### Model Development
- (Model, Data, Hyper Parameters) -> Training -> Error Analysis (Loop to #1).
- When error level is acceptable -> Audit Performance (Software and Business Perspective).
- Move to Production.
- Milestones:
  - Make sure the training set is good.
  - Perform well of training set/dev test.
  
### Attributes

- Skewed Data Distribution: Left or Right Skew; not ideal.
- F-Score: From Recall and Precision (The number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results).
